	<h1Five Nights at Freddy's</h1>
	<p>Whether you’ve ever wanted to or not, there is a high likelihood you have heard of Five Nights at Freddy’s at some point. The ludicrously popular indie game turned horror sensation is not only popular among fans of horror and fans of screaming YouTubers, but there is an enormous following among younger audiences, some as young as kindergarten age. It is rare a modern game reaches a level of popularity so great that you can find it on t-shirts at your local Target, and even more rare for an independently made game. So, of course, it could never stop at Five Nights at Freddy’s 4. Rather than make another iterative sequel, developer Scott Cawthon chose to try out some entirely new characters in an entirely new setting, with very different mechanics and storytelling techniques. The result, Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, seems entirely new but does that make it good?</p>
	
	<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location lets you know just how different an experience you’re getting out of the gate, with a narrate opening scene the first time you open the game, complete with voice actors. All of the games (except 4) had “voice acting” done by Cawthon itself, but the success of the series has afforded its creator a few trained voice actors. You are given a brief introduction to what is happening and the story of this particular game, then you throw yourself into yet another unpaid and dangerous job that no one would realistically ever work. A robot voice introduces you to your day to day tasks with dialogue reminiscent of Portal or The Stanley Parable, and you are given a setting which seems familiar. This is a deception because none of the mechanics are anything like you’re used too. You are not confined to a single room in Sister Location but you must instead navigate through hallways, restore power, and even fix the very animatronics that FNAF has trained you to fear.</p>
