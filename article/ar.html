      <h1>As augmented reality technologies emerge, we must place the focus on serving human needs</h1>
      <p>Augmented reality (AR), wearable technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are all really about human augmentation. They are coming together to create a new reality that will forever change the way we experience the world. As these technologies emerge, we must place the focus on serving human needs.</p>
	  
	  <h2>The Internet of Things and Humans</h2>

		<p>Tim O’Reilly suggested the word “Humans” be appended to the term IoT. “This is a powerful way to think about the Internet of Things because it focuses the mind on the human experience of it, not just the things themselves,” wrote O’Reilly. “My point is that when you think about the Internet of Things, you should be thinking about the complex system of interaction between humans and things, and asking yourself how sensors, cloud intelligence, and actuators (which may be other humans for now) make it possible to do things differently.”</p>

		<p>I share O’Reilly’s vision for the IoTH and propose we extend this perspective and apply it to the new AR that is emerging: let’s take the focus away from the technology and instead emphasize the human experience.</p>
		
		<p>The definition of AR we have come to understand is a digital layer of information (including images, text, video, and 3D animations) viewed on top of the physical world through a smartphone, tablet, or eyewear. This definition of AR is expanding to include things like wearable technology, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret your surroundings and deliver a contextual experience that is meaningful and unique to you. It’s about a new sensory awareness, deeper intelligence, and heightened interaction with our world and each other.</p>
		<h2>Seeing the world in new ways</h2>
		
		<p>Word Lens solves a human need. What if this same concept of using technology to augment your experience was extended to include other types of sensors, data, and networks? We are beginning to see examples of this, particularly in health care and wearable tech, with a higher goal of applying technology to help people live better lives. A perfect example of thought leaders exploring this new frontier is Rajiv Mongia, director of the Intel RealSense Interaction Design Group. Mongia and his team have developed a wearable prototype to help people with low or no vision gain a better sense of their surroundings. Combining a camera, computer vision, and sensors worn on the human body, the prototype is able to “see” objects within a few yards of you and tell you approximately where an object is located: high, low, left, or right, and whether the object is moving away or getting closer.</p>

		<p>This is all communicated to you through vibration motors embedded into the wearable. The tactile feedback you experience is comparable to the vibration mode on your mobile phone, with the intensity corresponding to how close an object is to you. For example, if a wall or person is near you, the vibration is stronger, and if it’s farther away, it’s less intense. Mongia said that people who’ve tried the prototype say it has promise, that it augments their senses and helps them to “feel” the environment around them.</p
