      <h1>NVIDIA 16nm Pascal Powered GeForce GTX 1080 Launching in May – Uses Full GP104 GPU With 2x Perf Per Watt and 8 GB Memory</h1>
      <p>NVIDIA is on the verge of launching their first 16nm FinFET based products featuring the highest performance and power efficiency to date. Pascal which is the name of their upcoming GPU architecture is built from ground up to deliver not only the best gaming performance but also the best compute performance. NVIDIA is going to present their Pascal GPUs at GTC 2016 but it seems like we already have a hint at when the consumer variant will be launching as Benchlife reports that NVIDIA is prepping the GeForce GTX 1080 for launch in May.</p>

      <h2>NVIDIA’s High-Performance GeForce GTX 1080 Rumored To Launch in May – Features GP104 Core, GP100 Consumer Variant Ships Later</h2>
      <p>We have long been awaiting to learn some information on the Pascal GPUs regarding which NVIDIA has kept really silent but it seems like the company is getting ready for a big showcase at GTC 2016. NVIDIA’s CEO, Jen Hsun Huang himself will deliver the opening keynote of GTC and present not only their latest 16nm FinFET architecture but the corresponding cards that utilize the Pascal GPUs.</p>

	  <p>Word is that NVIDIA’s Pascal will aim at both consumer and server markets as the chip to be in headlines would be the GP100 which is the flagship GPU in the Pascal lineup and the full fledged beast that will be shipping with Tesla and Quadro brands first. The consumer side will not be left alone as NVIDIA will launch their new graphics card based on the GP104 which will be solely aimed at gamers in Q2 2016. These cards will include new graphic side enhancements along with software side enhancements for APIs such as Vulkan and DirectX 12.</p>

	<p>The report mentions that NVIDIA’s GP104 will be utilized by a graphics card called the GeForce GTX 1080. Know we don’t know whether NVIDIA will be aiming for a 1000 series naming scheme or skipping it for something far more simpler but the name could change at any point since the launch is still a few months away. The GeForce GTX 1080 will be the fastest consumer offering for a while and while NVIDIA will also have the GTX 1070 in the same time frame, the latter will fall below the 1080 performance since it will be using a cut down configuration.</p>
